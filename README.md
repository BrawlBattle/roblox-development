_This is the journey of how I became a Roblox developer and how it first got me into programming and video game development._


**Game Overview:**
Roblox is an online video game platform primarily for kids where developers worldwide can come together and make spectacular games for players to play. Similar to Unity and Unreal Engine, Roblox has its own game creating engine that allows developers to make their own games using Roblox's resources and publishing them to the website. Within these games, they require you to have a valid understanding of programming, modelling, managing, collaboration, and other aspects that go into a video game.

**Background:**
Roblox is a game that I fondly grew up with as a kid, and over the years, I've played all these amazing game created by the community. When I was 15 years old, in 2016, I wanted to know what it took to make my own game since I was heavily inspired by the games I've played.
